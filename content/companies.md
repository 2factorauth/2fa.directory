2fa.directory is a directory of online services. Our mission is to be an independent source of information on which services support MFA/2FA and help consumers demand MFA/2FA on the services that currently don’t.
The directory is run by the non-profit organization __2factorauth__, registered in Sweden.

## The content
All our content is crowdsourced and moderated by __2factorauth__. If a person requests to list a new service and said service meets our [listing criteria][criteria] and [guidelines][guidelines], it gets published to the directory.

If you find your service listed here it most likely means one of your own users have requested it. If you already provide two factor authentication, the list will function as free promotion for your service.  
If you currently do not support two factor authentication, the listing functions as a reminder that your customers think this is an important thing for you to provide. 

### Edit a listing
If the data about a service is inaccurate you can create an [issue][issue] or [pull request][pr] on GitHub to update it.

## Takedown requests / DMCA
As __2factorauth__ is registered in Sweden, The Digital Millennium Copyright Act does not apply to 2fa.directory and thus DMCA requests will be ignored.
All the information on 2fa.directory is both public information and compliant with _fair use_. We believe consumers should be able to compare services to find the alternative that best fits them; We therefore do not remove listings.

If you have further questions you may contact us by [email](mailto:legal@2fa.directory) or by post:
