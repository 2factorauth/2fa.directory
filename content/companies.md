2fa.directory is a directory of online services. Our mission is to be an independent source of information on which services support MFA/2FA and help consumers demand MFA/2FA on the services that currently don’t.
The directory is run by the non-profit organization __2factorauth__, registered in Sweden.

## The content
All our content is crowdsourced and moderated by __2factorauth__. If a person requests to list a new service that meets our [listing criteria][criteria] and [guidelines][guidelines], it gets published in the directory.

If you find your service listed here, one of your users has requested it. If you already provide two-factor authentication, the list will function as a free promotion for your service.    
If you currently do not support two-factor authentication, the listing serves as a reminder that your customers think this is important for you to provide.

### Edit a listing
If the data about a service is inaccurate, you can create an [issue][issue] or [pull request][pr] on GitHub to update it.

## Takedown requests / DMCA
As __2factorauth__ is registered in Sweden, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act does not apply to the [2FA Directory][directory], and thus, DMCA requests will be ignored.
All the information on the [2FA Directory][directory] is public information compliant with _fair use_. We believe consumers should be able to compare services to find the alternative that best fits them; We therefore do not remove listings.
