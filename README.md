## Local installation

The website is based on the static site generator [Hugo][hugo].
To build locally you will need to follow the [installation instructions][hugo_install] for Hugo.  
[Ruby][ruby_install] is also required for some scripts.

After you've installed Hugo and Ruby, follow these steps to build the site locally:

1. Install NPM packages
   `npm install`
1. Install Ruby gems
   `bundle install`
1. Fetch entries:
   `./scripts/generate_entries.rb`
1. Generate regional pages:
   `./scripts/generate_regions.rb`
1. Run Hugo locally:
   `hugo serve`  
   The site should then be reachable at [127.0.0.1:1313][localhost].

> **Note**
> The [region-redirection](/functions/redirect.js) script does not run locally. You will therefore always be directed to
> the international page when using `hugo serve`.
